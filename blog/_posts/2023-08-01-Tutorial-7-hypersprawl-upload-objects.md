Note: 
-----
The performance of Hypershack version 0.1 is abysmally bad if there are any significant number of 4d objects being rendered. Thus at the it is severely restricted both what you can see at one session and what you can upload to Hypersprawl 0.1. When you upload objects to Hypersprawl 0.1, you can have only 10 objects on your block.
