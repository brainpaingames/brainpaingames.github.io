Even if level 6 maze in hypershack 0.2 contains only 4 tesseracts, it feels pretty hard to grasp where you are going. Below is a "map" of the level 6 maze, displaying selected slices over the dimension that's perpendiculr to the observable 3d space, first in the initial orientation and then after selected 90 degree rotations. 

Python code to produce the map is also provided.
