# 4D VR Game Control Guide

The game is designed to be played in stationary pose, not roomscale. Left controller is used to move in differet directions and right controller is used to rotate in different planes and plane combinations. Note that the forward direction is indicated in the game with a white crosshair, just turning your head will not change the direction vectors. You can think it like sitting in a plane cockpit, you can look aroud, but controls move the plane based on plane orientation, not pilot head orientation. 

## Left Controller Instructions

- **Forward/Backward Movement:**
  - Move the Thumbstick forward or backward to move in these directions - without gripping or pressing the trigger.
- **Horizontal Movement (Left/Right):**
  - Move the Thumbstick left or right to move horizontally - without gripping or pressing the trigger.
- **Vertical Movement (Up/Down):** 
  - Press the Trigger and move the Thumbstick forward or backwards to move vertically.
- **4D Movement (Hither/Thither):**
  - Press the Trigger and move the Thumbstick left or right to move in 4D directions (called hither and thither in this documentation).


## Right Controller Instructions

- **Rotation in Right-Up Plane (Roll):**
  - Press the Trigger and move the Thumbstick to left or right.
- **Rotation in Forward-Hither Plane:**
  - Press the Trigger and move the Thumbstick forward or backwards.
- **Rotation in Right-Hither Plane:**
  - Press the Grip and move the Thumbstick to left or right.
- **Rotation in Up-Forward Plane (Pitch):**
  - Press the Grip and move the Thumbstick forward or backwards.
- **Rotation in Right-Forward Plane (Yaw):**
  - Without Trigger or Grip pressed, move the Thumbstick to left or right.
- **Rotation in Up-Hither Plane:**
  - Without Trigger or Grip pressed, move the Thumbstick forward or backwards.

- **Double Rotation in Right-Up and Forward-Hither Planes:**
  - Press the Trigger and move the Thumbstick in both left-right and up-down directions. 
- **Double Rotation in Right-Hither and Up-Forward Planes:**
  - Press the Grip and move the Thumbstick in both left-right and up-down directions.
- **Double Rotation in Right-Forward and Up-Hither Planes:**
  - Without pressing the Trigger or Grip, move the Thumbstick in both left-right and up-down directions.


# Note on Keyboard Inputs

The keyboard inputs in our 4D VR game have been implemented for earlier development and testing purposes. While they offer a basic means to navigate and interact with the game environment, these controls are not as refined as the VR controller inputs and are not expected to be developed further regardless of some missing rotation combinations and possible bugs that may be found. 

These keyboard controls are included in the documentation for those who wish to explore the game without a VR headset or for preliminary testing purposes. We recommend using the VR controllers for the most complete and engaging experience in our game.
