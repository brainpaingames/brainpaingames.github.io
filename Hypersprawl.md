-----------

For quick access, [here](hypersprawl-0.1) is the latest version of hypersprawl. See change log and previous versions at the bottom of this page. If you are not familiar with hypersprawl, please read more about Hypersprawl below and get familiar with some of the tutorials linked on this page.

About Hypersprawl
-----------------

Hypersprawl is a four dimensional space where you can reserve your own block of 4d space to build four dimensional objects for others to see and move around. As of now, Hypersprawl is public and anyone can see anything uploaded in there - assuming it can be found, as 4d space is _large_. In the future some privacy management options may be added.   


Hypersprawl Layout and Addresses
--------------------------------

The location of a hypersprawl block needs to be defined in 4 axis, x, y, z and w. Each block is a standard size tesseract, so the location of a block can be represented by four signed integers, each representing how many blocks to a negative or positive direction of each axis from the center of Hypersprawl the block is. 

In the center of the Hypersprawl is - for obvious popular culture reasons, see book Snowcrash by Neal Stephenson - a large black tesseract called The Black Sun. 

Each block has a size of 10 units to each direction. The address of a block is the coordinates of the anchor point divided by 10. that is, the address of a block that spans over space defined by ranges 10-20 in x -axis, 40-50 in y-axis, 80-90 in z-axis and 20-30 in z-axis is 1,4,8,2. 

All blocks where any of the address coordinate is divisible with three is reserved to stay empty to be able to move around in the Hypersprawl.

The Hypersprawl is divided to following districts:
- The Black Sun: all address coordinates have absolute value less than 3
- Downtown, addresses closest to the Black Sun: all address coordinates less than 6, at least one larger than 3
- Suburbs: address coordinate absolute values less than 9, at least one larger than 6
- Outback: address coordinate absolute values less than 99, at least one larger than 9
- The Void: address coordinate absolute values less than 9999, at least one larger than 99

Reserving your address and pricing
----------------------------------

For now, you can reserve one address in the Void for free. Unfortunately we can not make guarantees that these addresses are going to be free forever, but you will get a notification at least 6 months in advance if there are going to be changes in pricing. However, they are going to be free as long as this project is otherwise economically feasible, so if you have the means, please consider upgrading your account and getting closer to The Black Sun.

Going to  [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/brainpaingames](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/brainpaingames) and making an one time donation of any sum will give you right to reserve one address in the Outback as well as one in the Void. Same as in the free addresses, that one off payment gives you the Outback address as long as the project is economically feasible. Any changes to pricing will be communicated at least 6 months prior to changes.

Downtown and Suburbs addresses are available for the ones making a subscription at [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/brainpaingames](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/brainpaingames). See available subscriptions for further details.   

The Black sun addresses are not available currently.

Important note: Making any payment or subscription creates no obligation whatsoever for brainpaingames to develop further or even run the Hypersprawl or Hypershack. 

To claim your Block(s), go to webpage [https://www.hypersprawl.com](https://www.hypersprawl.com) and enter your email address. You will receive an email with a link to a page you can use to manage your Hypersprawl blocks. Check your spam filter, as the email is coming from a relatively new domain. You are able to change your address to any available address on the district. 

Before venturing into uploading your 4d objects to Hypersprawl, it is highly recommended to get familiar with [Hypershack and Hypershack tutorials](https://www.brainpaingames.com/Hypershack.html).
