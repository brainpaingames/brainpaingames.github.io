Hypershack
----------

Hypershack is a standalone, private space to tinker and learn with 4d objects. It is basically just a static website with no concept of saving or  sharing your objects. If you want to save and share your objects - and see objects built by oter people, have a look at hypersprawl. Anyway, it is recommended to first create your objects in hypershack before uploading them to hypersprawl.
